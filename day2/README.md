# Day 2

I decided to write Day 2's solution in JavaScript/NodeJS

## The solution
My solution loads the input data from a text file and processes the data by splitting every line into its own element in an array.

It then uses forEach for parts 1 and 2 two check against the rules provided.

```
$ time node day2.js
part1Output
part2Output

real    0m0.536s
user    0m0.438s
sys     0m0.109s
```
